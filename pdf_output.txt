Farmer X downloads my app. 
Phase 1: First, he will select his preferred language (his own language). Then, the app 
language will switch to that particular language. This means if he selects Telugu, all the 
words and sentences will be in that language. 
Phase 2: After selecting the language, he should enter an OTP because farmers can enter 
their phone number and not email and password, which would be difficult, you know. 
After entering the OTP (or auto-selecting from the messages app, which is common 
nowadays), following OTP validation, he should accept location permission so that we 
can get his live location. Then, the model should decide which crops can be cultivated 
here and which are not favorable. These should be mentioned on the home page only. If 
he changes the location, then he needs to go to settings and change it instead of asking 
every time, which becomes complex. If he changes location, then again all the favorable 
and unfavorable crops should be mentioned accordingly and respectively. He should be 
taken to the home page with an icon on the right-hand side, like a dashboard, where he 
can see the schemes applied, previous history, etc. 
Phase 3: In the home page, first a scanner will be there using which he can upload a 
picture. After uploading the picture, the model should detect the disease and take us to 
the disease diagnosis or report of that disease. In that report, we should mention the 
disease, severity (if possible), and provide some pesticide companies who can solve the 
problem—like people who will come and cure the disease, you know. We should also 
mention the pesticides that can cure the disease along with contacts of pesticide 
cleaning people. If possible, mention the reason for the disease and precautions that 
should be avoided next time. If it is due to soil, then the model should mention it and 
also the crops that can be cultivated there. All these should be in text, and on the side, 
there should be a loudspeaker symbol. When he clicks it, he can listen to the text instead 
of reading (some people can read, some people can listen). 
Phase 4: In the home page, below the scanner, we should add a microphone where 
instead of uploading a picture, he can speak to it. Then, using his audio, the model will 
detect the disease, and we should get the same report that is there for photo upload. 
That means the model for this should be that much efficient. 
Phase 5: The next section in the home page is schemes available. If he clicks that, he 
should be taken to that page—the scheme application page—where a list of all the 
government scheme applications with the least deadline (like which is going to end 
soon) should appear first, from least to more time basically. Here, all the schemes that 
he can apply—we will provide only links to those official scheme pages, as we can't keep 
scheme applications here, you know—only links. 
Phase 6: In the home page only, we will add a navbar. In that navbar, we will add 
emergency assistance. We will use a weather API to forecast weather and caution the 
farmer if there is any cyclone, heavy rains, etc., beforehand. The app should notify the 
user if there are any sudden hazards like cyclones in that particular area, just like how 
we get notifications saying "heavy cyclone and thunderstorm may strike in your area." It 
should mention this in the emergency assistance page too. We should also mention the 
precautions that he should take and helpline numbers for help.
